# RoboDog
Project that explores machine learning on embedded systems with deployed local language models. 
Gesture and voice recognition were deployed on an handheld Arduino, with wireless communication with another Ardiuno deployed on a robotic dog that mimics a dog through commands (play fetch, call, do tricks).

# Tech Stack
EdgeImpulse (voice recognition), Numpy, Tensorflow, Arduino
